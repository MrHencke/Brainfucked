## About ##

I was bored today so i tried to make a brainfuck interpreter in C++. Not entirely sure if it counts as an interpreter.It can be compiled to be used through a CLI.

I also made one in Haskell with my limited knowledge, if i knew anything about ASTs and more syntax it would probably be less disgusting.
